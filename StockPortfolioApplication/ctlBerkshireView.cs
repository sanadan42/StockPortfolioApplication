             * for each of my account I want to display each of the equities I currently own, the cost I paid to buy, and the value I carried them at
             * I also want to display the total realized gains I have in that account
             * I also want to dispaly the total dividends that account has earned
             * I also want to disaply the sum of the the total realized and total dividends
             * I also want to display balances (slow down ninja Dodd)
             * 
             * I'm starting this journey with the summary account so that I can view all of my current equities in the aforementioned format
             * I then want to adjust this format so that I can display this data for a given year
             * to do that I will need to get the historical stock prices into my program
             * I will not rely upon the internet, but will create a new table in my databse for these prices and will then use the internet to populate that table
             * 
             * lots to do
             * lots to do
             * i'm going to stop for now as I am developing without a plan as to what I am attempting to do so i am unsure where I am going right now
             * and it's late
             * and I want to go to bed
             * so.... cookies?
